# opencode-skill-lister

Lists available [Skills](https://opencode.ai/v2/docs/build/plugins) in the
OpenCode sidebar — grouped into collapsible categories, sorted alphabetically.
Skills with `autoinvoke` enabled are tagged with ⚡.

**Categories**: a skill's frontmatter `category:` field wins; otherwise the
parent directory of its `SKILL.md` (when it isn't a generic `skills/` folder);
otherwise `general`. Un-categorized skills render as a flat list when no
skill declares any category.

Appends to `sidebar.content`, alongside other sidebar widgets like the
model recommender.

## What it shows

```

  Use this skill for any question about OpenCode itself
ponytail ⚡

```

- **Name** — the skill's `name`, falling back to its `id`
- **Description** — the skill's `description` (indented beneath the name)
- **⚡ autoinvoke** — skills that auto-invoke are tagged
