## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0-alpha.7] - 2026-09-27

### Changed

- Widened the `@opencode/plugin` range from `^2.0.15` to `^2.0.3`, matching
  what the plugin actually supports. Verified by typecheck and runtime import
  against 2.0.3, 2.0.10 and 2.0.18. **2.0.3 is the floor**: earlier 2.x
  releases ship no `./tui` subpath export, so the TUI entrypoint cannot
  resolve `@opencode/plugin/tui`.

### Added

- A runtime host-compat probe in CI: packs the real tarball, installs it into a
  clean project, and imports both entrypoints under Bun. Typecheck cannot catch
  a peer-only runtime dependency, because the dev tree always resolves it.

## [1.0.0-alpha.6] - 2026-09-27

### Fixed

- `@opencode/plugin` is now a real dependency instead of a peer. The plugin
  calls `Plugin.define()`, which is a runtime function, so a peer-only
  declaration left `@opencode/plugin` uninstalled — installing this package
  produced a plugin that failed to load with `Cannot find module
'@opencode/plugin'`. Pinned to `^2.0.15` so the host the runtime provides is
  the one that gets used.
- `opencode-plugin-kit` moved to `dependencies` for the same reason: it is
  imported at runtime, not just for types.
- `solid-js` moved from a peer to a dependency. The kit's barrel export pulls
  in `createSignal`/`createResource` from it, and `tui.tsx` imports
  `createResource`/`For`/`Show` directly, so a peer-only declaration left it
  uninstalled.
- Added the `/** @jsxImportSource @opentui/solid */` pragma to `tui.tsx`. Bun
  ignores `tsconfig.json` inside `node_modules`, so without the file-level
  pragma it fell back to React's JSX runtime and the TUI entrypoint failed to
  load with `Cannot find package 'react'`.

## [1.0.0-alpha.5] - 2026-09-27

### Breaking

- Requires an OpenCode v2 host. The TUI/context types moved from the legacy
  `@opencode-ai/plugin` package to `@opencode/plugin@^2.0.15`. The previously
  published `1.0.0-alpha.4` declared a peer range of `>=1.18.25 <2 ||
0.0.0-beta-19242`, which excluded v2 entirely — this release supersedes it.

### Changed

- Sidebar rendering and keymap wiring use the v2 `ui.slot` / `keymap.layer`
  contract.
- Moved to the v2 host plugin API via `opencode-plugin-kit@^1.0.0-alpha.6`,
  which reads connected providers from the host's integration list instead of
  scraping `auth.json`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-08

### Added

- Sidebar section listing available Skills with collapsible UI
